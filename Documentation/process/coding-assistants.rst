AI Coding Assistants
++++++++++++++++++++

This document provides guidance for AI tools and developers using AI
assistance when contributing to the Linux kernel.

AI tools helping with Linux kernel development should follow the standard
kernel development process:

* Documentation/process/development-process.rst
* Documentation/process/coding-style.rst
* Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst

Licensing and Legal Requirements
================================

All contributions must comply with the kernel's licensing requirements:

* All code must be compatible with GPL-2.0-only
* Use appropriate SPDX license identifiers
* See Documentation/process/license-rules.rst for details

Signed-off-by and Developer Certificate of Origin
=================================================

AI agents MUST NOT add Signed-off-by tags. Only humans can legally
certify the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). The human submitter
is responsible for:

* Reviewing all AI-generated code
* Ensuring compliance with licensing requirements
* Adding their own Signed-off-by tag to certify the DCO
* Taking full responsibility for the contribution
